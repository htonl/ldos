This software was designed for test purposes. It is the responsibility of this
software's operator to use this in a responsible fashion. The creator recommends
that the operator not break the law.

My goal with this code is to create a cli-tool with a suite of different networking
test tools. I started with a dos tool because it's really easy.

This software can implement a TCP SYN flood attack. More info on this attack can
be found in RFC 4987 - http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4987

This software can implement a UDP packet flood (big or small packet sizes).
More information on these types of attack can be found here -

TODO:
 * Add a bunch of error handling
 
 * More testing
